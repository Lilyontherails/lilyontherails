**Lily on the rails** is Lily's attempt to create and maintain a blog using GitHub Pages.
Posted here are Lily's musings on random things of their interest such as game-related
calculations, thoughts made out of books read, and possibly research- and work-related
matters.

This project is Lily's first attempt at using GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll, so
expect the output to be scuffed.

**Lily** currently studies physics for their Master's degree.
